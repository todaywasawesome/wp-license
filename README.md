# The WP License, or "Well Played" License
An "open source" license that embodies the principles that Matt Mullenweg is championing. The wp-license stands for "Well Played" License. "Well Played, now you pay."

## The principles embodied by the wp-license

1. "**Open Source**": The source code is available and needs to create the appearance of being practically open source but not open source <sup>TM</sup>.
2. **Responsibility**: Using code under the wp-license does not require being responsible or contribution unless you pass the "Less Profitable than Matt" profit bar.
3. **Less Profitable Than Matt**: Most importantly, anyone can use the WP License without paying or requiring contribution unless they are more profitable than Matt Mullenweg. If your project makes more money than Matt Mullenweg, you are required to contribute 8% of your revenue to Matt.
4. **Takebacksies**: If you own a company that would trigger the profitability clause but you sell it to someone else, you can now require them to contribute 8% of their revenue to Matt. It's not Matt's fault if your company becomes more successful after you sold it.
